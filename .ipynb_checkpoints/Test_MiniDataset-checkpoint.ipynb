Executive Summary  \\\\nIn support of the Spark M. Matsunaga Hydrogen Act of 2005 (Title VIII of the Energy Policy \\\\nAct) and in response to recommendations from the U.S.  Department of Energy’s ( DOE ’s) \\\\nHydrogen and Fuel Cell Technical Advisory Committee, the Hydrogen and Fuel Cell Tech nologies Office has been carrying out analyses to determine the availability of resources \\\\nwithin the United States  to provide hydrogen under different demand scenarios.\\\\n1 This analysis \\\\nwas conducted in support of DOE ’s H2@Scale initiative ,2 and this report examines the resources  \\\\nrequired to meet demand for an additional  10 million metric tonnes  (MMT)  of hydrogen in \\\\n2040.3    \\\\nThe technical potential of hydrogen production from fossil, nuclear, and renewable energy resources is presented . Updated maps describe the geographical distribution of hydrogen \\\\nproduction potential from renewable energy resources. The  results conclude that the technical \\\\nresource availabilit y of domestic energy resources is sufficient to meet an additional 10 MMT of \\\\nhydrogen demand in  2040, without placing significant pressure on existing resources.\\\\n4 Figure \\\\nES-1 shows the current (2017) and projected (2040) consumption of each energy resource, as \\\\nwell as the additional (individual) resource  required to produce 10 MMT of hydrogen in 2040. \\\\nWhile this level of hydrogen demand could result in a significant increase in renewable energy consumption in particular, the technical potential of each resource is estimated to be sufficient to meet the demand.  \\\\nFuture research , to enable the large -scale integration of hydrogen in the U.S. energy and other \\\\nsectors,  will include analyzing the geographic distribution of resources in relation to hydrogen \\\\ndemand  for a variety of applications. Additional techno -economic analysis is needed to \\\\nunderstand the economic potential of hydrogen in other industries, beyond transportation; such analysis is currently being undertaken by a multi- lab project initiated  by DOE in 2016. Finally, \\\\ninformation from techno-economic analyses should be used to continually update and inform R&D targets for energy production, hydrogen production, and hydrogen utilization technologies. \\\\n \\\\n1 The Spark M. Matsunaga Hydrogen Act of 2005 (Title VIII of the Energy Policy Act ; \\\\nhttps://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/PLAW -109publ58/pdf/PLAW -109publ58.pdf ) directed the Secretary of Energy to \\\\nconduct research activities “to address production of hydrogen from diverse energy resources including – fossil \\\\nfuels, which may include carbon capture and sequestration; hydrogen- carrier fuels (including ethanol and methanol); \\\\nrenewable energy resources, including biomass; and nuclear energy.”  This report ad dresses the technical potential of \\\\nhydrogen production from fossil fuels, renewable resources, and nuclear energy. Additionally, the Hydrogen \\\\nTechnical Advisory Committee recommended in 2017 that DOE take action to support “the potential for fuel shortages . For example, in Southern California where FCEV purchases have been strong, hydrogen fuel capacity is \\\\nbeing outpaced by demand. Sustained investments in additional production capacity buildout is needed. ” This report \\\\nidentifies the potential for diverse m ethods of hydrogen production to address two future scenarios of fuel demand \\\\nfrom fuel cell electric vehicles (FCEVs).\\\\n \\\\n2 https://www.energy.gov/eere/fuelcells/h2 -scale   \\\\n3 This future demand would be in addition to the current market demand of 10 MMT of hydrogen per year (Connelly \\\\net al. 2019). Currently, nearly all of the 10 MMT of commercially produced hydrogen is from natural gas steam methane reforming (EIA 2020).  \\\\n4 While the combined technical potential of domestic resources is more than sufficient to produce an additional 10' metadata={'source': '\\\\\\\\Users\\\\\\\\markc\\\\\\\\Hydrogen_mini\\\\\\\\Conelly_HydrogenResource.pdf', 'page': 6}\\n<End Document>\",\n",

The goal is to address the hurdle of fueling infrastructure and ensure that FCEV use expands and becomes a viable ZEV option for an increasing number of Californians in the future. AB 8 requires that reports provide analysis of current and projected future FCEV deployment and hydrogen fueling station development and identify needs for further hydrogen station network development.\n",
      "Predicted Answer: The purpose of California's Assembly Bill 8 is to provide a financial resource to several programs through a fee applied to vehicle and vessel registrations, and to support the development and deployment of advanced transportation and fuel technologies, including supporting infrastructure for both hydrogen-fueled fuel cell electric vehicles (FCEVs) and electrically charged battery electric vehicles.
