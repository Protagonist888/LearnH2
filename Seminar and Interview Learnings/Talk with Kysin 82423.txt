Companies have general disclosures

When you settle on ESG strategy, first setup a context. The context review in the area you operate.

Social - people inside and outside the fence and along the value chain. Data privacy. Diversity and inclusion. How people are treated.

Standards coming out of Europe are "overwhelming". Have to do a materiality assessment. Determine your materiality.

Society and environmental issues.

GRI is outward looking.

SASB is more company bottom line focused and inward looking.

Can't look outside or inside the fence. Have to do both. Require double materiality assessment.

How companies choose framework is based on what their customer is.

MPRL dove into bulding strategy from scratch. Policies around water. Focused on implementation.

People in US are all about reporting. Some produce nice ESG reports. Data collection and reporting systems not well built. HR system is not developed to collect the right data.

What about regulation? SEC regulations may become effective in 2025.

Data for pharmaceuticals is focused on discharge into water.

First step is a gap analysis. What do we need to report on? Where are we now?

Second point is collecting the right data.

Workiva - used for internal data collection.

External data - manually pull from ESG reports. Also look at Bloomberg, MSCI, and DJI.

Bloomberg information is wrong alot.

Consistent reporting of internal data.

Most trying to manage data reporting systems.
